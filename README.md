_Disclaimer_ This project is at a "I'm figuring out the interface" state, so nothing is working yet.

Do you have ideas suddenly and just wished you could catch them as fast as possible, as to not loose them, without having to interrupt what you were doing?

As I guy without a lot of more or less stupid ideas, I use Google Keep as a centralized place to put all of my thoughts that I deem worthy of consideration.

I recently started to use GitHub Projects for _coding_ project ideas as a [single project called "incubator" on my GitHub profile directly](https://github.com/ewen-lbh?tab=projects), and as issues or notes when the idea is related to an already-existing project and repo.

But when I don't get to decide _when_ this idea comes, and I often need to interrupt what am I doing to open github, get to the right page, input my idea and get back. And I find it frustrating.

So I started this CLI, as my first Go project, and my first project consuming a GraphQL API (GitHub's)

I'm also using an unofficial, reverse-engineered REST APIâ€”turns out Google Keep doesn't have an official one.

Enough rambling. Here's what you came for.

## Usage

The interface itself is pretty simple and POSIX-compliant

```bash
ideaseed [options] [[OWNER/]REPO [PROJECT [COLUMN]]] IDEA
```

`[OWNER/]REPO` allows you to select a repository. If not given, the idea will be added to Google Keep
If the `OWNER/` part is omitted, your GitHub username is assumed.

`PROJECT` allows you to select a project by name to put your card to. If omitted, `REPO` is assumed (eg `ideaseed myrepo "do this thing"` is the same as `ideaseed myrepo myrepo "do this thing"`)

`COLUMN`, much like `PROJECTS`, allows you to select a project's column by name, and defaults to `To-Do`

| -I        | --interactive    | Prompts you for the above options when they are not provided.                                        |

|           | --version        | Like --about, without dumb and useless stuff                                                         |

#### Color names

- blue
- brown
- darkblue
- gray
- green
- orange
- pink
- purple
- red
- teal
- white
- yellow

You don't have to specify the whole color name, just enough to be non-ambiguous:

- bl
- br
- d
- gra
- gre
- o
- pi
- pu
- r
- t
- w
- y

#### Relax. You don't need to remember those options

You can also use `ideaseed -?` to prompt you for some information:

- Where do you want to upload this idea? (github, google keep)
- If you decide to use github,
  - On your profile?
  - If not:
    - Which repo? (using REPO or OWNER/REPO) (autocompletes with repositories you contribute to)
    - Which column? (choices are the column names, and you can type the column's index to be quicker)
- If you decide to use google keep,
  - Which color? (defaults to white)
  - Some tags?
